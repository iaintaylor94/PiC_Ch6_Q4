# Programming in C
## Chapter 6
### Question 4

This problem is from chapter 6 of the textbook[^1]. This program implements a simple "printing" calculator - it will recieve an expression from the terminal and apply that expression to an "accumulator" within the program and then print the accumulator back to the terminal.

You may wish to run the program and compare its output.
